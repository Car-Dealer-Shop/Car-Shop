## <span style="color:#a34a28">**Conflict Resolution Strategy**</span>
As a team, we will try to keep our relationships as strong as possible. If we encounter a conflict, we will first try to resolve it amongst ourselves before informing the Team-Leader about it. If this conflict cannot be resolved, we will notify the instructional team, who will assist us in resolving it.

&nbsp;

## <span style="color:#a34a28">**Communication Strategy**</span>
We discussed as a group the time we would like to work in:

During class, we decided to go to the Zoom breakout room and work as much as we could.

After that, we can take a break before returning to our work. We chose a two-hour break. 

Friday is a day off for us, so we take it off and rest.

## <span style="color:#a34a28">**Work Schedule**</span>
How can we identify tasks, assign them, know when they are finished, and manage work in general?

We will assign the stylesheet part 'CSS' of our website to one of our team members, and we have decided to solve the java script functions together in order to solve them faster than individually, and we will keep everyone up to date on the slack channel.


&nbsp;

## <span style="color:#a34a28">**A project management tool will be used.**</span>
We will divide the tasks using Trello, and each member will have a separate branch on github to work on before the merge.

&nbsp;

## <span style="color:#a34a28">**Git Process**</span> 
We created an organization and a repo within it on github to save our code and added all team members and TA's to it so that we can all push our work and do a pull request and merge after the team leader checks that there is no conflict in the branch.
